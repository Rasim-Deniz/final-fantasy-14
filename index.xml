      <description>Our dataset consists in the characters&#39; wikis obtained from Final Fantasy Fandom Wikipages.
If you want to download the files containing the characters data click here. (You will have access to a zip file containing a .txt file for each characters of the wiki.)
To perform sentiment analysis, we&amp;rsquo;ve also used a dialogue collection.
From each character wikipage we obtained the information related to age, race, gender, affiliation and occupation using regular expressions.</description>

      <description>In order to perform the text analysis, we decided to prepare the data by applying tokenization and lemmatization to the character descriptions obtained from the wikipages. Words related to the structure of the wiki and not to a specific character of the story, where also removed from the text.
The frequency distribution of the 75 most common tokens is reported below. We tried to find the most important words related to each affiliation using both TF and TF-IDF.</description>
